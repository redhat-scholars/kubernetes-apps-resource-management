= Resource quotas

By default, containers run with unbounded compute resources on a Kubernetes cluster. 
Developer Sandbox is managed OpenShift environment, its cluster resources are tailored per development needs.

[#resourcediscovering]
== Discovering project resource limits

With resource quotas, cluster administrators can restrict resource consumption and creation on a namespace basis.

There will always be concerns that one Pod or Container could monopolize all available resources.

To avoid that, within a namespace, a Pod or Container can consume as much CPU and memory as defined by the `namespace's/project's` resource quota.

To discover the resource quota established for your namespace/project you can run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl get resourcequota
----

At namespace/project level a LimitRange policy is employed to constrain resource allocations (to Pods or Containers).

You can find out the LimitRange established for a namespace by running `kubectl get limitrange` and ask for its description.
In the case of RedHat Developer Sandbox these numbers are the following ones:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl describe limitrange resource-limits
----

The output should be something similar to:

[.console-output]
[source,text]
----
Name:       resource-limits
Namespace:  anasandbox-dev
Type        Resource  Min  Max  Default Request  Default Limit  Max Limit/Request Ratio
----        --------  ---  ---  ---------------  -------------  -----------------------
Container   cpu       -    -    10m              1              -
Container   memory    -    -    64Mi             750Mi          -
----

The above LimitRange has enforced the default request/limit for compute resources in the namespace and automatically injects them to Containers at runtime.

So, any deployment done without specifying any `request` or `limit`, like we did in the previous section, will use these default parameters.

Run the following request to get the parameters used by the JVM, changing the hostname with yours:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl another-greeting-app-asotobue-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/messages/sysresources
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Memory: 181 Cores: 1
----

So if the memory limit is set to 750Mi, why JVM uses only 181Mi?
This is because of JVM default ergonomics that we'll see in the following section.

[#resourcejvmergonomics]
== JVM ergonomics

The JVM has some defaults to determine the number of processors based on CPU quota, and the amount of memory used as heap memory. 

These parameters will determine the garbage collector (GC) algorithm and the performance of the application.

=== Default Values

The JVM comes with default memory value as starting point if it isn't set manually.

This value is relative to the total amount of memory available to the container and it's *1/4* of its value.

Now, we can see why the memory available when we queried `/sysresources` the available memory was 181. 
The total memory available in the Pod is `750Mi`, and 1/4 of this memory is `187` which is similar value we got in the application.

Also, JVM uses a default Garbage Collector implementation depending on 

.Default GC algorithms
|===
|Resources available |GC algorithm

|Fewer than two CPUs and less than 2GB of memory
|Serial algorithm

|>= 2 CPU's and >=2GB of memory
|G1GC
|===

The algorith can be overriden, for example starting the application with `-XX:+UseG1GC` to force the usage of `G1C1` algorithm.

To know exactly which values are used, you can start the JVM with the following commands:

`-XshowSettings:system`:: Shows system settings detected/set by JVM.

`-Xlog:gc=info`:: Shows information about GC (i.e which algorithm is used)

`-Xlog:os+container=trace`:: These traces print whether or not container detection is actually working and what values the JVM is determining to be in place by inspecting the cgroup pseudo filesystem of a deployed application.

In the terminal window, run the following command to deploy the same service as before but with `-XshowSettings:system -Xlog:gc=info -Xlog:os+container=info` flags set:

[#resourceadjustcontainer]
== Adjusting container resources

Adjusting resources depends a lot on the kind of application you are developing, if it's an enterprise application or a stateless service.
In this section we're going to explore how to adjust correctly this greeting application, and provide some generic information to be used for any Java application.

Deploy the application again:

In the terminal window, run the following command:

[tabs]
====
From local::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f apps/kubefiles/deploy-another-greeting-app.yaml
----
--

----
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-scholars/kubernetes-apps-resource-management/main/apps/kubefiles/apps/kubefiles/deploy-another-greeting-app.yaml
----
--
====

At this point, we can do two things to improve the resource limits used by the application: 

** provide some default values
** simulate traffic and adjust the limits

=== Simulating traffic

By using a tool called https://github.com/rakyll/hey[hey], you can run a load test on your server and see how your system performs under different circumstances.

Let's run a hey command against the route exposed by previous deployment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
export ROUTE_URL=http://$(kubectl get route another-greeting-app -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
curl $ROUTE_URL/messages/init
hey -n 10 -c 4 -v $ROUTE_URL/messages
----

In the Developer Sandbox click on `Observe` and select the `Metric` tab. 
You can select CPU Usage or Memory Usage query to check the resources consumed by each of your pods:

[.mt-4.center]
image::cpu_usage.png[CPU Usage,600,600,align="center"]

[.mt-4.center]
image::memory_usage.png[Memory Usage,600,600,align="center"]

Based on that you can adjust the limits in the Kubernetes resources:

[source, yaml]
----
resources:
    limits:
        cpu: 200m
        memory: 280Mi
    requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 280Mi

----
kubectl get pods

<1> Memory limit is updated

Run the following request to get the parameters used by the JVM, changing the hostname with yours:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
curl $ROUTE_URL/messages/sysresources
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Memory: 121 Cores: 1
----

The memory is adjusted to the new limits which is around the 25% of memory available. 

The container memory is not only used for allocating the JVM heap memory, but also for the JVM itself and the container.
For this reason, a good rule of thumb is to not allocate more than 75% of container memory as heap.

The `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage` flag let you set the JVM heap size dynamically using a percentage of the total avalable memory (`-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75`).

Undeploy the previous application and deploy one setting the max heap memory to 75%:

----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
Memory: 203 Cores: 1
----

Now the application is using 75% of memory as heap.

=== Assuming some defaults

Another option is assuming some defaults that might work in most applications and monitor and adjust accordantly.

A good starting point for an application of medium size application with creation of object, and high concurrency is:

vCPUs:: 2
Memory:: 4Gb
GC:: Parallel GC

[#resourcefinal]
== Final Words

Final numbers and tip & tricks that can help you on defining good numbers on the Kubernetes deployment files.

=== Limits and Requests

*CPU* limits and requests must have the same value as the JVM reads the number of processors available only during startup time.

*Memory* limits is the container memory, so you need to count not only the the JVM heap memory but all the memory required by the container.
We encourage you in JVM applications to set request and limit value to the same value.

=== How about GC

Setting the GC configuration is also important when deploying Java application in a container.

There are several studies suggesting the initial heap size and maximum heap size to the same value. Use the `-XX:InitialRAMPercentage` flag to set the initial value too.

To determine which GC to use depends on the amount of CPU and memory you assign to the container:

Serial GC:: 1 CPU

ParallelGC:: 2 CPU < 4Gb

G1GC or ShenandoahGC:: 2 CPU > 4Gb

ZGC:: 2 CPU > 28Gb

== Clean Up

Remove the deployed Kubernetes resources by running:
